# Detecting-the-resistome-in-ONT-waste-water-samples-using-a-newly-formed-pipeline
In this research, we developed a pipeline to detect antibiotic resistance genes in ONT data

The goal of this project is to develop a pipeline that is able to detect antibiotic resistance genes in metagenomic samples and give a global overview of what resistance genes are presence in used datasets.
